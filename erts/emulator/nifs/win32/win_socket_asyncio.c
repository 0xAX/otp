 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Purpose : Windows version of the asyncronous I/O backend.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Misc:
 * This is based of the Windows concept: I/O Completion Port.
 * This feature works on "all" kinds of I/O, even file I/O. But,
 * our implementation only deals with socket I/O.
 * The "asynchronous" access functions (that "can" block) that we
 * use are as following:
 *
 *   * WSASend, WSASendTo, WSASendMsg, WSARecv, WSARecvFrom, WSARecvMsg
 *   * AccepxEx
 *     (this is actually a function pointer, obtained at run time by
 *      making a call to the WSAIoctl function with the
 *      SIO_GET_EXTENSION_FUNCTION_POINTER opcode specified.
 *      The input buffer passed to the WSAIoctl function must contain
 *      WSAID_ACCEPTEX).
 *      To get the local and remote addresses, the GetAcceptExSockaddrs
 *      must be called. This function is *also* a function pointer
 *      obtained at run time by making a call to the WSAIoctl function.
 *   * Connectex:
 *     (this is actually a function pointer, obtained at run time by
 *      The function pointer for the ConnectEx function must be
 *      making a call to the WSAIoctl function with the
 *      SIO_GET_EXTENSION_FUNCTION_POINTER opcode specified.
 *      The input buffer passed to the WSAIoctl function must contain
 *      WSAID_CONNECTEX).
 *
 * But since we want them to "behave" the same way, we need to add 
 * some wrapper code to simulate the "completion behaviour".
 *
 * These functions (in erlang) should return simething *like* this:
 *
 *    ok | completion | {error, Reason}
 *
 * And if the return value was 'completion', the caller shall expect
 * the following message, when the "operation" has "completed" (success
 * or failure):
 * 
 *    {'$socket', Socket, completion, {Ref, CompletionStatus}}
 *
 * Where 'Socket' is the socket on which the call was made (for example,
 * 'socket:send(Socket, ...)), and CompletionStatus is the result of
 * actual operation: ok | {error, Reason}
 *
 * Examples:
 * * https://www.winsocketdotnetworkprogramming.com/winsock2programming/winsock2advancediomethod5i.html
 * * https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13382/A-simple-application-using-I-O-Completion-Ports-an

 *
 * Note:
 * We should have a "general" function that returns an info term
 * about this implementation: esaio_info()
